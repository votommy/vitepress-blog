<h2>December 28, 2022</h2>

<p>
    This year started out very uneventful, but quickly got exciting towards the last quarter.
    <br>
    A little recap since my last update: I quit my job on April 2021 with no back-up plan. I spent well over a year unemployed, searching for the perfect job.
    <br><br>
    I'm happy to say I found that job. After 1 year & 5 months living off my savings, I finally landed a job at a company that I'm confident I want to stay at. It's a remote job, which means I can work from anywhere in the world; so I thought, "Why not the most exciting city in the country?".
    <br>
    I packed all of my belongings into my car and drove to Las Vegas where I plan to spend the rest of my life. So, let's talk about it.

<p>
    Moving to Vegas was the best decision I've ever made, and it was entirely made possible by the new job I got. Not only is the job remote, but the company is based out of California, which means I get paid a California salary without the California cost-of-living.
    <br>
    Unfortunately, I have to reside in an apartment for the next few years until I've built a long enough work history to apply for a mortgage. Since I was unemployed for the past year, I essentially have no work history, so this new job will be the beginning of it. In order to even be considered for a mortgage, one needs at least 2 years of tax returns as proof of a steady income. The earliest I can start shopping for a house is 2 years from now. This gives me time to build my savings so I can have a substantial down-payment on the house I end up buying.
    <br><br>
    I think I ended this year much more positively than the last. I have no wishes for the next year other than to continue working at this dream job of mine while I experience Las Vegas for what it is. Who knows, maybe by the end of next year, the excitement of the city will subside, and I can consider moving to a calmer area within Nevada.
